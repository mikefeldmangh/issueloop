Yes, it has been quite a while since the last blog post. It's been about the same amount of time since any progress was made on the Issue Loop application. And now we have a problem with new signups. This is because we were forced to switch email services due to economic reasons. Alternative solutions have proven difficult with our current application host.

Unfortunately, no progress will be made unless there is a large demand. This is a one-person operation at the moment. If anyone feels this application can make a difference who has Ruby and Rails experience and wants to help work on it for free, please send an email and let us (me) know. Also let me know if you think Issue Loop is an important project that should continue. Thanks! 

**Update (12/9/2016)** It appears the email service we are using is now working, so new users are able to sign up.
