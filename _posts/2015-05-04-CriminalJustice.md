title: Criminal Justice Reform is Hot For Now, But...

It's really great that criminal justice reform is getting attention from government leaders and candidates since the recent events in Baltimore. But look at what it took to get here. All the events in Ferguson and other cities and then days of peaceful protest with no media attention in Baltimore. Nobody paid attention until the violence, looting and fires started. Unfortunately, sometimes only bad behavior brings the media out. Good behavior like peaceful protest doesn't bring in ratings.
 
Anyway, now the public and the media are putting the pressure on so the leaders have the incentive and backing to do something. But what will happen in a few days, in a few weeks or in a few months? The media's attention will undoubtedly move to something else. And if the media doesn't give airtime to a problem, the attention of the general public that isn't directly affected will go away too. The leaders may feel it's safe to stop trying. And nothing much will change. 

We've seen it happen before. What happened to the Occupy movement? The media and everyone else grew tired of it. How much really changed?

How do we turn around that trend? We have to keep caring about the problem. We have to stay informed on the important issues. We should talk to others about what's happening. Keep it in our minds and speak out so the leaders have it on their minds too.
