The code for Issue Loop has been released as open source. I realized a while ago it would be difficult for just one person to make a lot of progress on this application in spare time.  It also needs developers with more Rails expertise.

If you or anyone you know want to contribute to Issue Loop to make it even better, go to [the project repository on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/IssueLoop/issueloop).
