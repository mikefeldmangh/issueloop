We just recently heard the term _slacktivism_ but according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism#Use_of_the_term) it has been around since 1995. Let's talk about what it is and how it relates to Issue Loop.

## What Is Slacktivism? ## 

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism):

>Slacktivism (sometimes slactivism or slackervism) is a portmanteau of the words slacker and activism. The word is usually considered a pejorative term that describes "feel-good" measures, in support of an issue or social cause, that have little physical or practical effect, other than to make the person doing it feel satisfied that they have contributed. Slacktivism can be defined as the act of showing support for a cause but only truly being beneficial to the egos of people participating in this so-called activism. The acts tend to require minimal personal effort from the slacktivist.

From the [Oxford Dictionaries](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/slacktivism):

>Actions performed via the Internet in support of a political or social cause but regarded as requiring little time or involvement, e.g., signing an online petition or joining a campaign group on a social media website.

We like the second definition a little better since it does not include the part about having "little physical or practical effect". More on that below.

## Is It Bad? ##

One common goal of most slacktivism is to raise awareness of an issue. That is important. People can't form an opinion if they don't even know about the issue. And most forms achieve this to some extent since the slacktivist is usually sharing their opinion with their friends or followers on social media.

As far as actually making change, I would argue that there is a spectrum of slacktivism. While some activities probably have almost no effect (e.g. liking a post), others actually send an email for you to the appropriate person in government or add your name to a petition. That petition will also probably find its way to the right person or group.

There are other actions one can take that are almost always more effective. Some of these include:

  - Writing an email or letter to your government representatives or appropriate agency
  - Phone calls to your government representatives or appropriate agency
  - Writing a letter to the editor
  - Attending or speaking at a public hearing
  - Peaceful civil disobedience or protest

But these don't work for everyone or for every issue.

Many of us simply do not have the time or cannot take the risk to engage in certain types of activism. For some it can be intimidating to contact a government representative. Some cannot risk arrest which is a possibility during certain types of protest.

Take the example of a married couple working long hours to make enough money to pay bills. There is an issue that is important to them because it might mean a significant tax break. But they just can't find the time to write a letter, let alone risk losing a job to take time off work to attend a local government hearing. Does this make their opinion on the issue any less important than someone else's? No, their voices should be heard.

Some issues are not large enough to require protests in the streets. Most people would not take the time to actively protest in favor of a traffic signal at a dangerous intersection.

We would say slacktivism is better than not acting at all but it should not be a complete substitute for other activism.


## Is Issue Loop Slacktivism? ##

Issue Loop probably is on the spectrum, hopefully towards the side of being more effective.

Remember the traffic signal example above? Only a small number of people would bother writing a letter or contacting the government about that. Usually there would have to be enough accidents at the intersection before something is done about it. But Issue Loop could help in this case.

Issue Loop can also help all of us who are just too busy to know what the issues are or to write a letter or make a phone call.

As we mentioned above, hopefully we are more effective. If there are enough users in the Issue Loop community, the total voting results will be sent to the appropriate government representatives. So share Issue Loop on social media. Tell your friends, family, neighbors and coworkers about us. We will be even more effective with more users.

Finally, we do encourage you to educate yourself about the issues that are important to you and get as active as you can. Doing something is better than nothing.
