Issue Loop is finally live for everyone to use! We are really excited about this. Hopefully it's just the beginning. There is a lot more work to do. But we're looking at it as an experiment. If a lot of people start using it, then it can be a success. We feel strongly about our mission. We want everyone to have a bigger voice on the issues that matter to them. And we realize most people probably will not use the application if it isn't free. So it's free! However, it does cost some money to keep the application going and to add more functionality and to make it look a little better. (Let's face it. It's still a little rough around the edges.) So hopefully some of you who also really want this to succeed will want to donate a little money towards keeping it running. We will be adding a way for you to do that in the near future. In the meantime, add issues, vote on issues, and tell everyone you know about it. Thanks!
