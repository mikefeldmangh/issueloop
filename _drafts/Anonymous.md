Why no user profiles? Why is everything anonymous?
We've seen what happens on political sites and in comment sections of local newspapers and blogs. Some people get downright nasty and start name-calling. This isn't productive at all. We want to spark real debate and discussion about the issues but only about what really matters.

We will have ways to do that here in the future.
